# wind-turbine-farm
Designed a wind turbine nacelle and carried out calculations involving turbine power outputs. Created a mathematical model on MATLAB that calculated wind power output based on external factors such as wind speed, density, yaw angle, wake, and others. Conducted market research on different types of gearbox assembly which was ultimately designed on Fusion 360.
