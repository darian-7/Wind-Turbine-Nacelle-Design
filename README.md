# wind-turbine-farm

Project was split into two components: Design & Computing.
The design aspect of the project involved me designing a CAD model of my wind turbine nacelle, stakeholder considerations for a wind farm proposal, 2D sketches of wind turbine design.
I had to make design decisions using tools such as the 'pairwise comparison matrix' etc.
The calculations in the computing aspect of the report was computed using MATLAB, which led to the generation of useful graphs for the project.
The code computed on MATLAB produced annual power output for the wind farm, power variation with months, a layout of the wind farm, etc.
The report also contained yearly income/costs etc.
The combination of these findings led to a detailed report that presented a prospective wind farm proposal.
